# code_portfolio
A collection of various works I've completed throughout my academic and professional careers. Look through the folders to find various instances of my work over the years. You can find my resume here as well.

For example, you can find the project I did for Sheltercare. In the "case_study" folder, you can view a predictive forecasting project I completed in school. 

As time progresses, I plan to add projects using public data, so as to publish reproducable code. Stay tuned!
