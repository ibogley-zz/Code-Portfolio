## 2016 Election Analysis
Today, we will query information on the US presidential election  from 1976-2016 via the Harvard Dataverse, referenced in the bibliography.

```{r pack}
library(pacman)
p_load(here)
```

Now to read in the data:

```{r data}
data <- read.csv(here("data/1976-2016-president.csv"))
```

Now, we will use sql to query the database

```{sql connection=}

```
